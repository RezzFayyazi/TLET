# Predicting the Type of Exploit by Descrption using Transfer Learning
Every year, many systems around the world are exposed to various security threats with the growth of the Internet. It is
difficult and time-consuming for analysts to interpret the procedure and intended consequences of these
vulnerabilities. Predicting vulnerabilities' exploitability is crucial to stop harm to the systems promptly. Adversaries
may employ various strategies when attempting to target a system. Therefore, this project aims to predict the type of
exploits given cybersecurity descriptions to assist security analysts in patching the most critical vulnerabilities.
